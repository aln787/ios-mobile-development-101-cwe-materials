## Opening (# mins)

> Note: Let people know where restrooms and kitchen are located, as needed.

#### Instructor Bio

Welcome to Data Science 101! Here's a bit about me:
> Provide your name and brief bio. your background in iOS development, any experience you've had with GA, and one "fun fact" about yourself.

#### Introduce Yourselves

Before we dive in, a bit about you!

> Have students introduce themselves: name, what brings them to GA (ask for their current career & any specific goals), & one "fun fact".

> **Example Exercise**: *Have students submit this information in a format easily accessible so you can input information into a demo/dummy app that describes the class.*

> **Alternate Exercise**: *Have students share their information in pairs/groups and have other pairs/group members recite this information back to the class.*


#### Our Expectations

- You're ready to take charge of your learning experience.
- You have a Mac laptop and *optional* testing device.
- You've downloaded and installed the latest version of [Xcode](#).
- You're curious and excited about iOS development!

#### Our Objectives

> Note: Write workshop objectives on board before class

- Why this topic matters (general relevance)
- Why this topic rocks (interest/hook)

> Note: Tailor these 2 points to student interests. Relate to their career info & goals students described during attendance.
