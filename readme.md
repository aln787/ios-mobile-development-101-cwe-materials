Welcome to General Assembly's iOS Development 101. This repository contains all of the materials supplied for this workshop.

## Value Proposition

Have a great idea for an iOS app but no idea how to go about it? Want to learn more about the iOS ecosystem and how app development works? Curious about developing for iOS but confused by all the different tools required? Then this workshop is for you!

We’ll walk you through the industry standard tools used by iOS app developers, including Xcode (an integrated development environment), Swift (Apple’s open-source programming language), playground files, and more. 

You’ll identify the fundamentals you’ll need to build to succeed as an iOS developer while learning how to navigate and assemble your own sample mobile app. 

More importantly, you’ll build confidence in your ability to break down complex subject matter, understand industry trends in order to set goals, and chart your own path as a future iOS developer.


#### Students Will Learn How To:

- Explain relevant history and trends in iOS development.
- Identify key skills leveraged by IOS developers.
- Survey the common tools used within the iOS ecosystem.
- Apply key concepts and skills to build a basic iOS application.
