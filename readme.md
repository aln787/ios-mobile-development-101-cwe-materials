Welcome to General Assembly's iOS Development 101. We're all really excited that you're joining our General Assembly community. 

## Value Proposition

Through our iOS Development Immersive, we are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about developing mobile applications to solve real world problems.

In this repository, we provided a number of *required* and *optional* resources to prepare you for our course. In order to ensure your success in the course, weâ€™ve assembled the following pre-course onboarding materials. These may take you between 20-40 hours to complete.

## To Get Started


Please complete **all** items **before** your first day of class, so that both you and your computer will be prepared to hit the ground running. If you have questions in the meantime (or just want to say hi!), feel free to reach out to your admissions or course producer!
